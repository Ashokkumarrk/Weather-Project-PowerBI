🌦️ Weather Live Data Dashboard (Power BI | API-Based)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Weather Live Data Dashboard built using Power BI, integrating real-time weather data via a public Weather API.
The dashboard combines static report design with dynamic, API-driven data refresh, enabling users to monitor current weather conditions and city-wise comparisons interactively.

The primary goal is to demonstrate API integration, data transformation, and visualization skills in Power BI.

🔗 Data Source (API Integration)

Data Source: Public Weather API

Connection Type: API (JSON response)

Integration Method:

Power BI → Get Data → Web

API response parsed and transformed using Power Query (M Language)

Refresh Type: Dynamic (API-based live data)

This ensures the dashboard reflects updated weather metrics whenever the dataset is refreshed.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Live weather data fetched using API

✅ City-wise weather insights (India-focused)

✅ Dynamic filters for City, Date, and Weather Condition

✅ KPI cards for temperature, humidity, and wind speed

✅ Interactive charts and map visualization

✅ Clean, business-ready dashboard layout
